		  I may have never walked<br>
		  in your shoes,<br>
		  but I can see<br>
		  your soles are worn,<br>
		  your strength is torn<br>
		  under the weight of a story<br>
		  I have never lived before.<br>
		  Let me hold the door for you.<br>
		  After all you have walked through,<br>
		  it is the least I can do."<br>
